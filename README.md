# Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning


Welcome to the Car Price Prediction project! 

This GitHub repository is dedicated to helping you estimate how much a car should be sold for using smart computer programs. The project analyzes various crucial details about the car, such as its name, age, current selling price, mileage, fuel type, seller type, and previous ownership history. By taking all of these factors into account, the project creates a highly accurate model for determining car prices.
